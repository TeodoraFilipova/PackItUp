Project Name: Pack It Up (Android Application)
Project Author: Теодора Филипова (teodoraf)

Project Purpose: 	
To create a todo-style application which offers support while packing for a trip. 
The application visualizes Categories of items to pack. 
Clicking on a Category visualizes the items to be packes in that Category. 
Long-clicking a Category or an Item marks them as "Packed" (or "Not yet packed").
The drawer navigation offers functionality which allows the user to keep adding Items to one of the predefined Categories in order to customise the Packing List.
